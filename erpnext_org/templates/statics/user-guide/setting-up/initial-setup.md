help the system to operate efficiently. If your setup module is completed
successfully, the system will work flawlessly.

After a successful sign-up / installation of ERPNext, on your first sign-in,
you will get a setup wizard. Make sure that you enter all the information that
the form asks for. Do not skip any step. It is important to note that, filling
up the Setup Wizard is an important step. This fast paced wizard is designed
to make  quick entries into the setup system. If you skip this step, you will
have to manually fill in the required information at a later stage, which
could be a time-consuming process; thus, it is advisable to fill all the
information in the setup wizard that pops up after your installation is
complete.
