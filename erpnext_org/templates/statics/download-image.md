<p class="lead">Download a pre-installed Virtual Box Image</p>

#### How To Install

You will need Oracle's Virtual Box to use the image:

[https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

Import the .ova file into VirtualBox. Though the default settings of the appliance should be good enough for most users, you may need to change them if you face performace issues.

The virtual appliance uses Debian GNU/Linux 7.

The credentials of the virtual image are:

    username: erpnext
    password: erpnext
    mysql root password: erpnext
    erpnext database name: erpnext
    erpnext database password: erpnext

Once the Virtual Machine boots, use your HOST operating system's browser and go to:

http://localhost:8000
and login using:

    user: Administrator
    password: admin
