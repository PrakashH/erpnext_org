Mumbai is a big city and there are many hotels in town based on your budget. Budget hotels start at $50 per night and you could live grandly for $100 per night. The conference is close to the center of the city, you could either choose a place close to the airport or in South Mumbai, the "downtown".

1. We don't have a favorite, but TripAdivisor does a pretty good job. [Check out TripAdvisor for Mumbai Hotels](

2. You can also choose to [stay with someone listed at AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/s/mumbai?checkin=09%2F24%2F2014&checkout=09%2F25%2F2014&source=bb)

Note: Avoid hotels at the North of the city in hubs like Juhu, Andheri or Goregaon. It would be too much to travel to the conference venue.

#### Budget

If you want to stay real close to the venue, here are a couple of budget hotels (approx $50 per night):
